# API Security Audit Report

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the RESTful API, identifies potential vulnerabilities, and suggests improvements to ensure the application adheres to modern security best practices.

---

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. **Authentication: JWT-based**

- **Method**: Token-based authentication using `jsonwebtoken`.
- **Implementation**:
  - Tokens issued on `/login` with a 1-hour expiry.
  - Protected routes require a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.
  - JWT stored in **HTTP-only cookies** for secure browser usage.
- **Validation**:
  - Implemented `protectRouteMiddleware` to verify and decode JWTs using a secret.
  - Token is securely signed using a secret from `.env`.

### 2. **Environment Configuration**

- **Tool**: `dotenv`
- **Description**: Secrets like `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, and `JWT_SECRET` are stored securely in a `.env` file and never committed to version control.

### 3. **Password Security**

- **Tool**: `bcrypt`
- **Strategy**:
  - Passwords are hashed before saving to the database with a salt round of 12.
  - `confirmPassword` is removed from the schema before storing user data.

### 4. **Input Validation & Sanitization**

- **Custom validation middleware** (`validateRequestBody`, `checkInput`) ensures all required fields are present.
- **MongoDB Injection Protection**:
  - **Tool**: `mongo-sanitize`
  - **Sanitizer**: Applied to `req.body`, `req.query`, and `req.params` via `sanitizeMiddleware`.

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection**:
  - **Tool**: `xss`
  - **Sanitizer**: Applied via middleware to clean all incoming strings.

### 5. **Security Headers**

- **Tool**: `helmet`
- **Headers Included**:
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
  - `X-XSS-Protection`
  - `Content-Security-Policy` (default from Helmet)

### 6. **HTTPS Enforcement**

- **Middleware**: `forceHttps`
- **Behavior**: In production mode, all HTTP traffic is redirected to HTTPS using `x-forwarded-proto` header.

### 7. **Global Error Handling**

- **Central Middleware**: `errorHandler`
- Catches all unhandled exceptions and responds with consistent JSON error structure.
- Prevents sensitive internal errors from being exposed.

##  Vulnerabilities Checked

| Vulnerability         | Protection Present? | Notes |
|-----------------------|---------------------|-------|
| NoSQL Injection       |  Yes              | Using `mongo-sanitize` middleware |
| XSS (Cross-site Scripting) |  Yes        | Using `xss` sanitizer on input |
| SQL Injection         |  Not applicable   | Project uses MongoDB |
| JWT Token Tampering   |  Yes              | JWT is signed and verified |
| Sensitive Data in Responses |  Yes      | Passwords are never sent to clients |
| Open CORS             |  Not configured  | CORS middleware not added, but not public yet |
| Rate Limiting         |  Not implemented  | Can be added using `express-rate-limit` |
| Brute-force Login     |  Not implemented  | Can be improved with throttling on login attempts |
| HTTPS Only (Production) |  Yes           | `forceHttps` redirects insecure traffic |

## 🔍 Recommendations

1. **Implement Rate Limiting**:
   - Prevent brute-force attacks by limiting repeated requests.
   - Suggested package: `express-rate-limit`.

2. **CORS Configuration**:
   - Use `cors` middleware to restrict allowed origins.
   - Example: Allow only `https://yourdomain.com` in production.

3. **JWT Refresh Strategy**:
   - Implement token refresh if session needs to persist longer securely.

4. **Session Expiry Handling**:
   - Notify users when tokens expire or logout automatically on the client side.

5. **Logging**:
   - Add audit logging for login, failed login, and critical actions using a logging tool like `winston`.

6. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**:
   - Customize Helmet's default CSP to control which sources are allowed.

## Conclusion

The API demonstrates strong foundational security principles for authentication, input sanitization, password handling, and HTTPS enforcement. A few improvements (rate limiting, logging, CORS control) are suggested to further harden the API for production deployment.

> **Overall Status: Secure (with minor enhancements recommended)**
