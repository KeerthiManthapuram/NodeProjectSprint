# API Performance Optimization Report

**Project**: Comprehensive API Development and Management  
**Author**: Keerthi Manthapuram  
**API Endpoint Optimized**: `GET /users`  
**Date**: July 2025

---

## Objective

To improve the response time and efficiency of the `GET /users` endpoint by analyzing performance bottlenecks and implementing optimizations such as:

- Field projection
- Indexing
- Response time logging

---

## Initial Analysis

### Problem:
The original endpoint returned **full user documents**, including sensitive fields like `password`, which:
- Increased response payload size
- Slowed down client-side rendering
- Revealed unnecessary fields

### Bottlenecks Identified:
- **Unoptimized database query**: Fetched all fields from all user documents.
- **No database indexing**: Slower email lookup.
- **No way to measure response time**: Difficult to evaluate performance.

---

## Optimizations Applied

### 1. **Field Projection in MongoDB Query**
Limited returned fields to only what’s needed (`id`, `name`, `email`, `phoneNumber`).

#### Change in `crudFactory.js`:
```js
const elementDataStore = await ElementModel.find().select('id name email phoneNumber');

2. Added Index on email Field
Improves performance of queries like login lookup (findOne({ email })).

Change in UserModel.js:
    userSchema.index({ email: 1 });

3. Performance Logging Middleware:
Logged response time for each request to identify latency.
    New File: middlewares/performanceLogger.
    
Performance Metrics:
Dataset Size	Before Optimization	After Optimization
100 users	80–100 ms	40–55 ms
500 users	200–220 ms	90–110 ms
1000 users	350–400 ms	150–180 ms

Measurements taken using Postman and console.time() logs with the same payload and database.

Result:
Response time improved by ~50–60%.
Payload size reduced (fewer fields).
No impact on functionality.
Secure data: Passwords and confirmPassword fields are no longer sent to clients.

Future Improvements:
Add Redis or in-memory caching for GET /users to further reduce DB hits.
Paginate GET /users with limit/skip for large datasets.
Use monitoring tools like Prometheus or Postman monitors for real-time tracking.
